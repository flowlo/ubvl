# ubvl
This repository contains my work for [Compilers (german: _Ãœbersetzerbau_)](http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ubvl/) at Vienna University of Technology (summer semester of 2013).

## Tasks
Throughout the semester we were to accomplish eight tasks. The first two (`asm?`) focused on writing AMD64 assembly, whereas the following six constructed a compiler for a primitive language. Refer to the original assignments (German) in the corresponding subdirectories.

## Tests
We tested our compilers against specific cases which can be found [here](https://github.com/flowlo/ubvl-test).

## Results
Optimized code earned me some bonus points.
